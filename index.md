``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";

Commit Changes: 
I made 3 lines of "hi". <br> 
The first one, has a singular '#'. <br>
The second line, has 2 '#'. <br>
The third line, has 3 '#'. <br>
I found that the more '#' symbols you add, the smaller the text gets. <br>
I also tacked on a Teemo. <br>
Also added code example since I'm not too sure what happened but making sure the step is complete. <br>
